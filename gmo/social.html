<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>GM foods available in Canada are considered safe for us to eat. While Canada does produce some GM crops, most of them are exported. Labelling GM foods is not required in Canada, so it can be difficult to know if a food product contains GM ingredients.  If you are concerned about eating GM foods, call food companies to see if they use GM ingredients, look for “GMO free” foods, try buying organic foods or plant your own garden with GMO-free seeds.</p>

<h2>What should I do if I’m concerned about eating GM foods?</h2>
<li>If you are concerned about eating GM foods, try the following tips:</li>
<li>Call food companies. If you are interested to know if a certain food contains GM ingredients, the food company may be able to answer your questions.</li>
<li>Visit specialty stores. Some smaller food companies label their products as “GMO free.”</li>
<li>Buy organic foods. Organic foods are not genetically modified.</li>
<li>Plant a garden. When you buy plants or seeds, ask if they have been genetically modified.</li>
<li>Voice your opinion. Call food companies, contact Health Canada at info@hc-sc.gc.ca or the CFIA and let them know you would like GM foods to be labelled.</li>

<h2>The Right to Know continued...</h2>
<p>The FDA says companies can label foods on their own to say they are or aren’t GM, provided they keep it truthful. But that puts an added burden on farmers to plant, harvest, and ship GM crops separately from non-GM crops. That creates extra cost, which is passed along to the consumer.</p>

<p>Food companies like Nature’s Path and Gerber baby food choose to use non-GM ingredients. The fast food chain Chipotle removed GM foods from its menu. Whole Foods Market promises to label all GM products at its U.S. and Canadian stores by 2018.</p>

<p>The bottom line: If you live (and eat) in the U.S., unless it’s otherwise stated -- or it’s certified organic -- it’s a safe bet that your food is GM. Makers who don’t use GM ingredients clearly say so on labels.</p>
