<h2>What is a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO)?</h2>
<p>A GMO is a plant-based organism, like a seed, that:<br></p>
<p><li>Has its genes (DNA) altered to act in a way that does not happen naturally and/or</li>
<li>Contains genes from another plant-based organism</li>
GMOs are used to grow GM foods.</p>

<h2>What GM foods are approved in Canada?</h2>
<p>Since 1994, about 85 GM foods have been approved for sale in Canada. This includes GM foods grown in Canada and GM foods that have been imported from other countries.
Only four main GM crops are currently grown in Canada including canola, soybean, corn and sugar beet. Most of these GM crops are exported to other countries.</p>

<h2>How are GM foods regulated?</h2>
<p>Before a GM food can be sold in Canada, Health Canada makes sure it is safe to eat and will not harm your health or the environment. Health Canada completes a thorough safety assessment on all GM foods before they are allowed to be sold. A safety assessment can take many years.</p>

<h2>Are GM foods labelled?</h2>
<p>No. GM foods do not have to be labelled in Canada. However, some food companies choose to label their products “GMO free”.

Labelling of GM foods is challenging. This is because a food like GM corn can be used as an ingredient in many other foods like cereal, yogurt, frozen entrees and canned soup. All of these foods would need to be labelled as having genetically modified ingredients.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits of genetically modified foods?</h2>
<p><li>GM crops have been developed to have certain benefits. GM foods may:</li>
<li>Resist damage due to weather, like frost or draught</li>
<li>Grow more easily in some environments (like dry soil conditions)</li>
<li>Produce more crop, helping to keep food prices lower</li>
<li>Ripen slower and last longer during shipping</li>
<li>Bruise less easily</li>
<li>Need less pesticides (like herbicides and insecticides)</li>
<li>Have less disease caused by insects or viruses</li>
<li>Have more of a certain nutrient like vitamin A found in Golden Rice, a GM rice crop used to fight malnutrition in developing countries</li>
